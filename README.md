This repository contains of the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The initial dataset:

Project Summary
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Files:

1. run_analysis.R is the R code with the 5-steps analyses:

2. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

3. The output of the 5th step is called 'dataAvg.txt'.
